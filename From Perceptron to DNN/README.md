We are going to write our own simple feedforward neural network using `Python` and `NumPy` (the standard numeric library for Python). We will start by implementing just a simple neuron, or perceptron, then we define the training algorithm for this simple model.
The second part consists in defining a simple neural network to perform digits classification.
