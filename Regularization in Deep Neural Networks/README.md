# Regularization in Deep Neural Networks

We will explore how to develop a simple Deep Neural Network for a classification problem. We will explore two common libraries: TensorFlow and Keras.
Then we will explore how to face a well known problem that is common to encounter during the training phase: the Overfitting.
Finally, we will study how to perform a fair model selection.
You can take a look at how Tensorflow and Keras are designed.  https://keras.io/
